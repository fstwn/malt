# Geometry Processing with Intrinsic Triangulations
#
# Intrinsic triangulations are a powerful technique for computing with 3D
# surfaces. Among other things, they enable existing algorithms to work "out
# of the box" on poor-quality triangulations. The basic idea is to represent
# the geometry of a triangle mesh by edge lengths, rather than vertex
# positions; this change of perspective unlocks many powerful algorithms with
# excellent robustness to poor-quality triangulations.
#
# This course gives an overview of intrinsic triangulations and their use in
# geometry processing, beginning with a general introduction to the basics and
# historical roots, then covering recent data structures for encoding intrinsic
# triangulations, and their application to tasks in surface geometry ranging
# from geodesics to vector fields to parameterization.
#
# This course was presented at SIGGRAPH 2021 and IMR 2021.
