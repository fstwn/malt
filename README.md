# Malt and DDU/IAS Research Virtual Environment

## About Malt

Malt is a collection of Hops components for Rhino Grasshopper.

- The Hops components run using a local [ghhops-server](https://github.com/mcneel/compute.rhino3d/tree/master/src/ghhops-server-py).
- Rhino functionality is provided using [Rhino.Inside.Cpython](https://github.com/mcneel/rhino.inside-cpython).

## About the DDU/IAS Research Virtual Environment

....

## Prerequisites

This requires you to have the following:
- Windows (unfortunately Hops and Rhino.Inside.Cpython won't work under OSX for now)
- [Anaconda / Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- Rhino 7.4 or newer
- [Hops](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/grasshopper/hops-component/) ([Install using Rhino package manager](rhino://package/search?name=hops))

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository into a directory of your choice

First off, clone or download this repository and unzip it (if needed) into a
working directory of your choice. For the purpose of this guide, I will use
`C:\source\repos\malt`.

### 2. Set up the Virtual Environment using conda environment file

**If you have not installed [Anaconda / Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
yet, NOW is the time to do it.**

Set up a new conda virtual environment with the name `ddu_ias_research` using
the provided environment file by running:
```
conda env create -f "ddu_ias_research.yml"
```

Now we activate our newly created conda environment:
```
conda activate ddu_ias_research
```

### 3. Installing the malt python package

With the virtual environment activated and while in the root directory of the
malt repository (where `setup.py` is located), run the following command:
```
pip install -e .
```
*NOTE: This will install the `malt` package and its submodules in development
mode, in case you want to extend and/or modify it. If you simply want to use
the provided functions and components, you can also simply call
`pip install .`*

### 4. Installing `compas` and its extensions for use in Rhino

Finally, we install `compas_rhino` and the other compas extensions by running:
```
python -m compas_rhino.install -v 7.0 -p compas compas_rhino compas_ghpython compas_fab compas_cgal malt
```

### 5. Running `hops_server.py` in the Virtual Environment

Make sure your current working directory is the directory where `hops_server.py` 
is located. Otherwise browse to this directory using `cd`. Make sure the
`ddu_ias_research` conda environment is active, otherwise run:
```
conda activate ddu_ias_research
```

Now you can start the Hops Server by running:
```
python hops_server.py
```

### 6. Using one of the provided Hops Components in Grasshopper
