# Getting started with git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system. It is at the
heart of GitHub so to speak (hence the name). You need an installation of git
to collaborate on repositories or simply update your local repositories in
an efficient and easy way. There are two possibilities to use git in the
context of working with this repository:

## 1. The GitHub desktop client

If you want to interact with the repository in a user-fiendly way without
using the command line, you can use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
**Please note that using git via the command line (i.e. `git pull`) will not
work out of the box when using GitHub Desktop. You'll have to use the graphical
interface of the client instead!**

## 2. The Git command line

If you feel comfortable working with the command line, you can use the original
distrbution of [Git](https://git-scm.com/). If you want to use the Windows
command line or Powershell with git, make sure to enable this option during
the installation process!
